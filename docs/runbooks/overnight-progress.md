# Overnight autonomous delivery — progress

Checkpoint contract for the 20-step pipeline. Updated after every completed
step and at least every 30–45 minutes. Chat memory is not the record; this is.

CURRENT_PIPELINE_STEP: 09/20 — PO revision and cancellation (NOT STARTED)
CURRENT_TASK: none in flight
LAST_GREEN_COMMIT: c89ac1d
LAST_PUSHED_COMMIT: c89ac1d
WORKING_TREE: clean
RUNNING_TESTS: none
CURRENT_BRANCH: phase/2-procurement (tracking origin)

ACTIVE_WORKTREES:
- `khan-mandi-rms` — phase/2-procurement. Single lane, clean tree.

ACTIVE_DATABASES (none to be dropped):
- `khan_mandi_dev` — development, seeded and visible
- `test_khan_mandi_dev` — test runs
- `khan_mandi_p1_exit` — Phase 1 exit verification, seeded
- `khan_mandi_t17a_check`, `khan_mandi_t16_check`, `_t15_`, `_t14_`, `_t13_`,
  `khan_mandi_ledger_check`, `khan_mandi_inv_check`, `khan_mandi_freshcheck`

ERRORS_REMAINING: 0

NEXT_EXACT_ACTION: Step 09 — Task 2.7, purchase order change control.
`PurchaseOrderVersion` capturing the superseded header and lines, plus
`revise_purchase_order`: revision reason, revised_by, revised_at, the
current-version link, and a version-history screen showing the difference.
An issued order is never edited in place.

Guards to add (PRC-019 – PRC-022): supplier cannot change once a receipt
exists; destination cannot change after receipt; a revised quantity cannot
fall below what has been accepted; a cancelled order cannot receive.
Receipts arrive in Step 10, so those guards are written now against a
`_received_base_quantity(line)` helper that returns zero until then —
write the helper and its call sites now, not the zero as an assumption.

After Step 09: BATCH 3 certification over Steps 07–09 — comparison
arithmetic, award, PO lifecycle, issued immutability, version history,
cancellation guards, maker-checker, scope, demo, htmx, no ledger effect,
migrations and gates. Confirm again that no journal or ledger entry cites
a procurement source.

NEXT_EXACT_COMMAND:
```
cd "C:/Users/muama/Desktop/Khan Mandi/System/khan-mandi-rms"
git branch --show-current                     # expect phase/2-procurement
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest apps/procurement -q   # expect 215 passed
```

DEMO_STATE: `khan_mandi_dev` seeded and visible; sign in as `moamel`,
organization DEMO-KHAN-MANDI; start at http://127.0.0.1:8000/inventory/stock/.
Procurement: 3 suppliers, 6 catalogue rows, 4 purchase requests, 2
quotations, one award and 3 purchase orders seeded
and visible; the seed is idempotent (same counts on re-run). Routes:
/procurement/suppliers/, /procurement/catalogue/, /procurement/requests/,
/procurement/quotations/,
/procurement/requests/<pk>/comparison/,
/procurement/orders/.
Requests are raised by `demo-storekeeper` and decided by `moamel`, because
maker-checker is a database constraint and one actor could not do both.
RECONCILIATION_STATE: all three inventory verifiers clean on `khan_mandi_dev`
and `khan_mandi_p1_exit`. Batch 2 additionally confirmed that no journal or
ledger entry cites a procurement source: requests and quotations produce
zero postings, which is the claim both documents rest on.

ASSUMPTIONS:
- An award requires a reason unconditionally, not only when the winner is
  dearer as PRC-017 states. Stricter than specified, and deliberate: a
  field that is usually empty is a field nobody reads.
- Purchasing issues but never approves a purchase order. The spec does not
  name the split; it follows the same separation the request already uses.

BLOCKERS: none

## Phase 2 starting facts

- Reuse `GOODS_RECEIVED_NOT_INVOICED` (already mapped, account `2-01-02-001`).
- Supplier balances are derived from documents, never a mutable field.
- Goods receipt posts through the existing inventory kernel; procurement adds
  no second posting path.
- Demo: three suppliers (DEMO-MEAT-SUPPLIER, DEMO-CHICKEN-SUPPLIER,
  DEMO-GROCERY-SUPPLIER) against the existing five items.
- `view_supplier` is Django's **builtin** view permission for the `Supplier`
  model, not a custom one. Declaring it in `Meta.permissions` is an
  `auth.E005` clash. The codename is still `procurement.view_supplier`.
- Every lifecycle guard re-reads its document under a row lock rather than
  trusting the instance it was handed. Found twice — `_require_draft` in
  Task 2.3 and `award_quotation` in Task 2.5. Assume the next one too.
- Demo and test dates must stay meaningful as the calendar moves. Two
  defects came from validity windows that had silently expired.
- `_require_draft` re-reads status under a row lock rather than trusting the
  instance handed to it. A stale in-memory DRAFT would otherwise let a line
  be added to an approved request, and no constraint could catch it.
- `ProcurementDocumentSequence` is procurement's own gapless counter.
  Numbers are drawn at submission, never at creation.
- `apps/procurement/views.py` subclasses the list/write/action bases from
  `apps.inventory.views` rather than copying them. Extracting them into
  `apps.core` is worth doing when a third module needs them; it is a refactor
  of certified code and does not belong inside a feature task.

## Closed follow-ups

Both Phase 1 hygiene items are done.

- **Traceability** (`e1afe79`). All 60 aspirational rows reconciled; 275
  unanchored citations given their file; `tests/test_traceability.py` fails the
  build if a row cites a test that does not exist.
- **Suite runtime** (`d9ff702`). The three demo-seeding files went from 18:48
  to 2:05 on the same 123 tests, by sharing one seed per module. Two
  transactional classes moved to `test_location_concurrency.py` and
  `test_import_constraints.py`; `refuse_transactional_tests` stops the
  incompatible combination from ever going quietly green. The move broke
  two traceability citations, which the full suite caught and `51024b6`
  fixed forward.

Measured honestly: the three files went 18:48 → 2:05 back to back on the
same machine, but the **full** suite went 38:42 → 34:56, not the ~22
minutes that saving alone implies. The file-level number is a controlled
comparison; the full-suite number is against a baseline taken on a
different day. Where the rest of the difference went is not established,
and no further optimisation was attempted — the known repeated setup was
the item, and it is addressed.
