# Overnight autonomous delivery — progress

Checkpoint contract for the 20-step pipeline. Updated after every completed
step and at least every 30–45 minutes. Chat memory is not the record; this is.

  `khan_mandi_ledger_check`, `khan_mandi_inv_check`, `khan_mandi_freshcheck`

NEXT_EXACT_ACTION: Step 11 — Task 2.9, the authoritative receipt POST.
One transaction: receipt status, accepted `StockMovement` effects through
the **certified inventory kernel** (never a second posting path),
`StockBalance` and `StockLocation` quantity, valuation, and a balanced
`Dr Inventory Control / Cr GOODS_RECEIVED_NOT_INVOICED` journal — plus
source identity, idempotency, audit and document links.

Step 10 left these deliberately in place for it:
- `GoodsReceipt.posted_by/posted_at/reversed_at/reversal_reason` columns
  exist and are null; two check constraints already refuse a POSTED with
  no timestamp and a DRAFT that carries one.
- `GoodsReceipt.is_ready_to_post` is the precondition, derived from the
  lines. Posting should require it.
- `GoodsReceiptLine.accepted_value` is the value to post: the accepted
  share of `delivered_quantity × unit_price`.
- `TestNothingPostsYet` asserts no posting service and no route exists.
  **Those two assertions must be deleted in Step 11**, not worked around —
  they are the boundary marker, and removing them is the deliberate act of
  crossing it.

Price basis (PRC-028): a linked order line supplies the price; an unlinked
receipt requires an entered one. Never the supplier catalogue.

Read `apps/inventory/ledger.py` lock order before adding locks.

NEXT_EXACT_COMMAND:
```
cd "C:/Users/muama/Desktop/Khan Mandi/System/khan-mandi-rms"
git branch --show-current                     # expect phase/2-procurement
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest apps/procurement -q   # expect 293 passed
```

DEMO_STATE: `khan_mandi_dev` seeded and visible; sign in as `moamel`,
organization DEMO-KHAN-MANDI; start at http://127.0.0.1:8000/inventory/stock/.
Procurement: 3 suppliers, 6 catalogue rows, 4 purchase requests, 2
quotations, one award, 3 purchase orders, one order
revision and 4 goods receipts (all DRAFT) seeded
and visible; the seed is idempotent (same counts on re-run). Routes:
/procurement/suppliers/, /procurement/catalogue/, /procurement/requests/,
/procurement/quotations/,
/procurement/requests/<pk>/comparison/,
/procurement/orders/,
/procurement/orders/<pk>/history/,
/procurement/receipts/.
Requests are raised by `demo-storekeeper` and decided by `moamel`, because
maker-checker is a database constraint and one actor could not do both.
RECONCILIATION_STATE: all three inventory verifiers clean on `khan_mandi_dev`
and `khan_mandi_p1_exit`. Batch 2 additionally confirmed that no journal or
ledger entry cites a procurement source: requests and quotations produce
zero postings, which is the claim both documents rest on.

ASSUMPTIONS:
- An award requires a reason unconditionally, not only when the winner is
  dearer as PRC-017 states. Stricter than specified, and deliberate: a
  field that is usually empty is a field nobody reads.
- Purchasing issues but never approves a purchase order. The spec does not
  name the split; it follows the same separation the request already uses.

- Task 2.0 §7 gives the receipt three statuses only: DRAFT, POSTED,
  REVERSED. Inspection is line data, and readiness is derived
  (`is_ready_to_post`), so no INSPECTED/READY state was invented.
- Delivery-reference uniqueness is scoped per supplier, not globally.
- An inspected-but-unposted receipt reserves nothing on the order;
  `add_receipt_line` compensates by also subtracting other drafts.

BLOCKERS: none

## Phase 2 starting facts

- Reuse `GOODS_RECEIVED_NOT_INVOICED` (already mapped, account `2-01-02-001`).
- Supplier balances are derived from documents, never a mutable field.
- Goods receipt posts through the existing inventory kernel; procurement adds
  no second posting path.
- Demo: three suppliers (DEMO-MEAT-SUPPLIER, DEMO-CHICKEN-SUPPLIER,
  DEMO-GROCERY-SUPPLIER) against the existing five items.
- `view_supplier` is Django's **builtin** view permission for the `Supplier`
  model, not a custom one. Declaring it in `Meta.permissions` is an
  `auth.E005` clash. The codename is still `procurement.view_supplier`.
- Every lifecycle guard re-reads its document under a row lock rather than
  trusting the instance it was handed. Found three times; now stated once
  in `apps/procurement/lifecycle.py::lock_and_require_status` and covered
  by `TestTheStaleInstanceRule`. Every new lifecycle service uses it.
- Demo and test dates must stay meaningful as the calendar moves. Two
  defects came from validity windows that had silently expired.
- `_require_draft` re-reads status under a row lock rather than trusting the
  instance handed to it. A stale in-memory DRAFT would otherwise let a line
  be added to an approved request, and no constraint could catch it.
- `ProcurementDocumentSequence` is procurement's own gapless counter.
  Numbers are drawn at submission, never at creation.
- `apps/procurement/views.py` subclasses the list/write/action bases from
  `apps.inventory.views` rather than copying them. Extracting them into
  `apps.core` is worth doing when a third module needs them; it is a refactor
  of certified code and does not belong inside a feature task.

## Closed follow-ups

Both Phase 1 hygiene items are done.

- **Traceability** (`e1afe79`). All 60 aspirational rows reconciled; 275
  unanchored citations given their file; `tests/test_traceability.py` fails the
  build if a row cites a test that does not exist.
- **Suite runtime** (`d9ff702`). The three demo-seeding files went from 18:48
  to 2:05 on the same 123 tests, by sharing one seed per module. Two
  transactional classes moved to `test_location_concurrency.py` and
  `test_import_constraints.py`; `refuse_transactional_tests` stops the
  incompatible combination from ever going quietly green. The move broke
  two traceability citations, which the full suite caught and `51024b6`
  fixed forward.

Measured honestly: the three files went 18:48 → 2:05 back to back on the
same machine, but the **full** suite went 38:42 → 34:56, not the ~22
minutes that saving alone implies. The file-level number is a controlled
comparison; the full-suite number is against a baseline taken on a
different day. Where the rest of the difference went is not established,
and no further optimisation was attempted — the known repeated setup was
the item, and it is addressed.
